                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p1>I'm Psych Andrei Lopez, a dedicated student currently pursuing my education at the University of the Cordilleras. While I'm in the early stages of my college journey, I have a growing passion for programming, which is a significant part of my coursework. My enthusiasm for technology extends beyond the classroom, as I enjoy experimenting with web development and exploring the world of online gaming. Beyond the classroom, I have a passion for online gaming and the camaraderie it fosters, as well as the physical challenges and teamwork of playing basketball. I'm also an enthusiast of exploring new places through travel.
                    While I have not yet participated in extracurricular activities, I'm eager to take a leap into the world of sports by planning to join the varsity basketball team this school year. My ultimate goal is to become successful in both my academic pursuits and future career.</p1>
